                <p className="mx-5">A comic book series is a run of comic books that is set to run for a certain number of issues or indefinitely.  
                   The term can be a little confusing.  A series is also sometimes called a title, which refers to the entire series, 
                   not a single, discrete unit.  <b>Ongoing Series</b> are series that have no definite end date.  <b>Mini-Series</b> are
                   comic book series that are scheduled to run only a certain number of issues, usually six or fewer, and then 
                   end.  <b>Maxi-Series</b> run more than six issues and then end.  Mini-series and maxi-series can both 
                   be referred to as <b>Limited Series</b>.
